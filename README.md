# reusable-web-component
I created this form using web components.
My goal is to create an event listener that will help me output name, email, and a comment after I submit the form.
I'd also like to output the time stamp when the form is submitted. 
I'm having a hard time doing this in JavaScript and I really don't know how to go about getting the function to work in my connectedCallBack().
I'd really appreciate the help!
